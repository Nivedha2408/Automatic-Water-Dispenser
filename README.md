# Automatic-Water-Dispenser
This project presents an innovative solution for an Automatic Drinking Water Dispenser that utilizes an ultrasonic sensor and a motorized pump to provide a convenient and hygienic way to dispense water. The system detects the presence of a user's hand or cup within a predetermined distance, triggering the pump to dispense water for a set duration. This project aims to provide a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly drinking water dispenser suitable for various settings, including offices, schools, and public spaces.

Working Principle:
1. Object Detection: The ultrasonic sensor continuously emits high-frequency sound waves and detects the echoes reflected from objects within its range.
2. Distance Calculation: The sensor calculates the distance between the sensor and the object based on the time-of-flight of the sound waves.
3. Triggering the Pump: When the calculated distance falls within the predetermined threshold (typically 10-15 cm), the system triggers the motorized pump to dispense water.
4. Pump Activation: The pump remains activated for a set duration (typically 5-10 seconds), allowing the user to fill their cup or container.
5. Deactivation: After the set duration, the pump deactivates, and the system returns to its idle state, waiting for the next user.
